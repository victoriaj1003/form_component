<!-- Design a REUSABLE form component that meets the following requirements: -->
<!-- ● The initial state of the component should be an empty input box and an ADD button. -->
<!-- ● If the user enters text to the input box, clicking ADD should add that text to a list. -->
<!-- ● There should be a way to delete a list element. -->
<!-- ● On form submit, the list elements should be submitted as an array. -->
<!-- ● Please provide documentation on how to implement your component. -->
<!-- Please use only straight HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Do not use any CSS frameworks or external Javascript libraries. -->

<!-- for web components, html goes in template. -->
